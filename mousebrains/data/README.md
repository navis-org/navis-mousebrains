# Meshes

## Allen CCF
The mesh for the Allen CCF was generated by downloading the
25um resolution image stack from [here](https://download.alleninstitute.org/informatics-archive/current-release/mouse_ccf/average_template/),
and using scikit learn's marching cube algorithm to generate
a surface mesh (thresholded at 20).
